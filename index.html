<p>Sibaji Panda is a well-known name in the deaf community in India. This confident and self-made deaf leader and teacher has been working for the empowerment and development of the community.Born in Odisha in 1974, Sibaji Panda lost his hearing at the age of 10. Learning sign language was not a hurdle for him as his elder brother was also deaf.It was while Sibaji was studying in a mainstream school system that he realised the huge shortage of quality educational facilities for deaf children. After completing his initial schooling, Sibaji started working as computer trainer at the Delhi Foundation for Deaf Women.A chance meeting with German professor Ulrike Zeeshan changed the direction of his life and Sibaji started to officially document Indian Sign Language or ISL, making him the first person in India to do so.
This motivated Sibaji to pursue higher education and he went to the University of New England for a masters in Applied Linguistics. He then took up the post of a senior lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire and stayed there for over a decade. While there, Sibaji worked on the development of a graduation-level course in Applied Sign Language Studies (BAASLS).<a href="

The team will enhance deaf students’ ability to communicate in English, enabling them to reach out beyond the deaf community and to find new forms of employment. The project also aims to create a model of teaching that can be used in other countries, including Ghana and Uganda.<a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news/developing_new_ways_of_teaching_english_with_deaf_people_india.php/"target="_blank"> More Details</a></p>

<h2>HAPPYHANDS SCHOOL IS ENABLING DEAF CHILDREN IN RURUAL IN ODISHA</h2>
<p>Located in the village of Sindurpur in rural Odisha, Happy Hands School is more than living up to its name. It was launched in 2016 by prominent Deaf leader and teacher Sibaji Panda,who has been working actively to promote Indian sign language. Most schools in India don’t encourage teaching in sign language and rely on oral methods. This forces deaf students to grasp through lip reading.
Happy Hands School is changing this by using a bilingual education system where sign language is combined with forms of teaching to impart quality education. The staff here is proficient in sign language, which makes the students comfortable and promotes better learning.<a href="http://hhsd.rurallifeline.in//"target="_blank">HAPPYHANDS School</a></p>
